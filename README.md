My name is Skip, but you probably know me as [@SecurityShrimp](https://twitter.com./securityshrimp).
I'm a Red/Purple teamer and currently work in adversary simulation in the biomedical industry.  
In a past life I was a high-availability large ingest Splunk Security Architect.

My main hobby is 🏎car racing🏎, and I own a BMW racing company, [Team Verb Racing](http://teamverbracing.com).
Other hobbies include:
* Being an internet goblin and curating memes
* Craft beer
* Cigars
* Rum
* Guns
* Video games

- 🔭 I’m currently working on adding trainable neural network support to [DNSrazzle](https://github.com/f8al/DNSrazzle).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to train and interact with neural networks via python.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any python projects in the offensive cyber security space.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with implementing and training neural networks to integrate them with [DNSrazzle](https://github.com/f8al/DNSrazzle).
- 💬 Ask me about red teaming and adversary emulation, cars (expertise on e36 and e46 chassis BMW `///M` cars), rum, or memes.
